## UserVault class

A Vault that is associated with a single owner.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class UserVault extends Vault 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Vault](./lib-base.vault.md)

## Remarks

The SDK uses the base [Vault](./lib-base.vault.md) class as a generic container of collateral and debt, for example to represent the [total collateral and debt](./lib-base.readablemoneyp.gettotal.md) locked up in the protocol.

The `UserVault` class extends `Vault` with extra information that's only available for Vaults that are associated with a single owner (such as the owner's address, or the Vault's status).

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `UserVault` class.
